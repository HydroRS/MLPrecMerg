# Satellite-gauge-Precipitaiton-Merging

> Merging mutiple satellite-based precipiation and gauge observation based on the single/double machine learning algorithms including RF, ANN, SVM, EML, RF-RF, RF-ANN, RF-SVM and RF-EML. The main program is 'Main_Merge_ensemble.m'. We have also uploaded the test data. The user can download the test data, and modify the root folder in the  main program 'Main_Merge_ensemble.m'. Then the program can run directly. Note that the SVM algorithm is not built-in matlab function, the users needs to download dnd install the Libsvm package before running the program.
